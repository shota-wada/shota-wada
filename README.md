### [Portfolio Optmial Allocation and Value-at-Risk (VaR)](https://github.com/shota-wada/optimal_portfolio_allocation)
- Derive and implement analytical solution for Global Minimum Variance (GMV) using Lagrangian optimization, and computed optimal asset allocation from provided volatility and correlation matrices.
- Extend mean-variance optimization to target 7% return, and analysed allocation and portfolio risk under scaled correlation regimes (x1.0, x1.3, x1.8), revealing amplification of high-correlation markets.
- Illustrated how Sharpre Ratios with vary with evaluation frequency (daily, monthly, and quarterly) and translated these into loss probabilities, to explain the illusion of increased risk with higher monitoring frequency.
- Backtesting by calculating 99% 10D VaR using rolling standard deviation, and identifying the breach events during market stress (COVID-19, 2020-2021 coorrection) and visualized comparative risk across indices.
- Replicated rolling standard deviation with EWMA volatility using λ = 0.72. Assessed how smoother volatility inputs impact VaR estimation and breach sensitivity.

### [Asian & Lookback Options Pricing](https://github.com/shota-wada/asian_lookback_option)
- Priced path dependent exotic options (Asian Option and Lookback Option) using the risk-neutral expectation of discounted payoff under Monte Carlo simulation.
- Implemented the **Euler–Maruyama scheme** to simulate asset price paths for both Asian and Lookback options.
- Used multiple scenarios to vary strike, volatility, and maturity to observe sensitivity in exotic option pricing.
- Compared and analyzed pricing differences across option types and simulation parameters.

### [Machiene Learning for Asset Prediction: Asset Trend Classification Using SVM](https://github.com/shota-wada/machiene_learning)
- Predict short-term return trend of a selected asset (binary: uptrend = 1, downtrend = 0).
- Focused on binomial classification, avoiding label formats like `[-1, 1]`.
- Constructed an SVM classifier with a custom feature set tailored to the chosen asset (e.g. equity, ETF, crypto).
- Demonstrated moderate predictive power on directional trends
- Explored trade-offs between overfitting and generalization through regularization and kernel choice
- Evaluated feature importance using recursive elimination and information gain
- Reinforced understanding of kernel methods, hyperparameter sensitivity, and data leakage risks in financial ML.
- Highlighted limitations of predicting short-term returns in efficient markets.
- Demonstrated full-stack ML implementation including model tuning, evaluation, and interpretation.
