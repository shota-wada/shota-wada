### [Portfolio Optmial Allocation and Value-at-Risk (VaR)](https://github.com/shota-wada/optimal_portfolio_allocation)
- Derive and implement analytical solution for Global Minimum Variance (GMV) using Lagrangian optimization, and computed optimal asset allocation from provided volatility and correlation matrices.
- Extend mean-variance optimization to target 7% return, and analysed allocation and portfolio risk under scaled correlation regimes (x1.0, x1.3, x1.8), revealing amplification of high-correlation markets.
- Illustrated how Sharpre Ratios with vary with evaluation frequency (daily, monthly, and quarterly) and translated these into loss probabilities, to explain the illusion of increased risk with higher monitoring frequency.
- Backtesting by calculating 99% 10D VaR using rolling standard deviation, and identifying the breach events during market stress (COVID-19, 2020-2021 coorrection) and visualized comparative risk across indices.
- Replicated rolling standard deviation with EWMA volatility using Î» = 0.72. Assessed how smoother volatility inputs impact VaR estimation and breach sensitivity.
